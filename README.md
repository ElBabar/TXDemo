# TXDemo
Demo board for CAN and XBee communication

Developped for a UTT course.

This board has onboard CAN communication and fits a XBee adapter (see XBeeSX868_adapter) in order to communicate with both, using a homemade protocol.

This board is a demo board for functions that will be implemented on a robot taking part in the Coupe de france de Robotique.
